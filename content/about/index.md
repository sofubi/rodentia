# About Me

I'm a software engineer specializing in Python applications and web technologies. I spend most of my time working in the backend.

I've been working in software since 2018 and have spent most of my time in very small (less that 20 person team) startups.

As far as software goes I love to think about how the developer experience can be better and I enjoy working to wrangle legacy code.

I'm often busy with writing personal projects, powerlifting, spending time with my wife and dog, playing videogames (I like rogulikes mainly), or exploring Greater Boston.

I aspire to do many things which leads me to constantly be looking for ways to organize myself.

Eventually I'll launch a product that helps addicts in recovery, until then I'm working at a company called Numerated as a Software Engineer.
